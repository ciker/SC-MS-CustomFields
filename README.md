# Custom Fields with Source Query

This repo contains some custom fields I needed, to be able to insert the source field with a sitecore query. This is so that the items where this field is used can be context aware, and the path shown can be based on where the item is. Sitecore by default does not support query for this General Link field - this customization should do the trick. 

The only field added today is the custom field based on the General Link field. You can build and install the Sitecore Items package only (MS Custom Fields-Items-Only-1.0.zip), or just install the entire package (MS Custom Fields-1.0.zip)
